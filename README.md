# Push Swap

Sort numbers into a stack in ascending order, based on a set of pre defined operations.

This project isn't about using the fastest sortling algorihtm there is, but instead create one that sorts X numbers in a stack, using only the given set of instructions and with the help of using another stack (stack b) in order to minimize the number of operations.

All code is written in accordance to the norminette version running at the time of project completion.

## How to use

In order to run this project you will have to compile it using make and then run the executable with a list of X, non duplicate numbers and not larger than an integer.

```
make
```

Example:

```
./push_swap 5 3 2 1 4
```

The best way to understand how the algorithm works is by using one of the online push_swap visualizers available.
